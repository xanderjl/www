## Lest Ye Become The Domain Expert Of Said Abyss

I'm paraphrasing my mentor here, but the point is that you should be careful of becoming the domain expert of a particular technology. It's easy to get sucked into a particular technology and become the go-to person for it, but it can also limit your career growth and opportunities.

**Let's break down some of the pros and cons.**

## Pros

- **Increased job security:** Becoming the go-to person for a particular technology can increase your job security, as you become an indispensable asset to your team and company.
- **Higher pay:** As a domain expert, you may be able to negotiate a higher salary or receive bonuses for your expertise.
- **Opportunities for advancement:** Your expertise may open up opportunities for advancement within your company or in other organizations.
- **Increased job satisfaction:** Being a domain expert can be personally fulfilling, as you are able to solve complex problems and make a significant impact on your team and company.

## Cons

- **Narrow focus:** Becoming a domain expert in a particular technology may limit your exposure to other technologies and prevent you from developing a broader skill set.
- **Risk of obsolescence:** Technology is constantly evolving, and becoming a domain expert in a particular technology may leave you vulnerable to becoming obsolete if that technology becomes outdated or is replaced by newer technologies.
- **Increased pressure:** As the go-to person for a particular technology, you may be under increased pressure to perform and deliver results, which can be stressful.
- **Limited career mobility:** If you become too specialized in a particular technology, it may limit your career mobility and make it difficult to transition to other roles or industries.
